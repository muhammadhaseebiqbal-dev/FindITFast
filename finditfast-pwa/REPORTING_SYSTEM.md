# User Feedback and Reporting System

## Overview

The User Feedback and Reporting System has been successfully implemented for the FindItFast PWA. This system allows users to report issues with item locations and provides store owners with valuable feedback to maintain accurate inventory information.

## Features Implemented

### 7.1 Reporting Interface ✅

**Components Created:**
- `ReportButton` - Touch-friendly buttons for different report types
- `FeedbackModal` - Modal dialog for collecting detailed user feedback
- `ConfirmationToast` - Toast notifications for user action feedback

**Report Types Supported:**
- **Item Missing** - Report when an item is not found at the indicated location
- **Item Moved** - Report when an item has been relocated within the store
- **Item Found** - Confirm that an item was successfully located
- **Confirm Location** - Verify that an item is correctly positioned

**Key Features:**
- Mobile-first design with 44px minimum touch targets
- Accessible UI with proper ARIA labels
- Visual feedback with color-coded buttons (red for missing, orange for moved, green for found, blue for confirm)
- Optional comment field for additional context
- Loading states and error handling

### 7.2 Report Processing and Storage ✅

**Services Implemented:**
- `reportService` - Main service for handling report operations
- Enhanced `firestoreService` - Database operations for reports
- Automatic report counting and item flagging

**Core Functionality:**
- **Report Logging** - All reports stored with item ID, store ID, timestamp, and optional user location
- **Report Counting** - Automatic increment of report count for negative reports (missing/moved)
- **Admin Flagging** - Items automatically flagged for review when they receive 3+ negative reports
- **User Location** - Optional geolocation capture for reports (with user permission)
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

**Data Models:**
```typescript
interface Report {
  id: string;
  itemId: string;
  storeId: string;
  userId?: string;
  type: 'missing' | 'moved' | 'found' | 'confirm';
  timestamp: Timestamp;
  location?: { latitude: number; longitude: number };
}
```

## Integration

The reporting system is fully integrated into the existing floorplan viewer:

1. **ItemInfo Component** - Updated to include reporting buttons below item details
2. **FloorplanViewer** - Passes store context to enable reporting
3. **FloorplanPage** - Provides the complete user experience

## User Experience Flow

1. User views item on floorplan
2. User taps item pin to see details
3. Reporting buttons appear below item information
4. User selects appropriate report type
5. Modal opens for additional comments (optional)
6. Report is submitted with confirmation toast
7. System automatically processes report and flags item if needed

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage includes:
- **Unit Tests** - 35 tests covering all components and services
- **Integration Tests** - End-to-end reporting workflow validation
- **Error Handling** - Network failures and edge cases
- **TypeScript Safety** - Type checking for all interfaces

## Requirements Compliance

✅ **Requirement 4.1** - "Item Missing" button implemented with clear visual design  
✅ **Requirement 4.2** - Reports logged to Firebase with all required data  
✅ **Requirement 4.3** - Confirmation messages displayed via toast notifications  
✅ **Requirement 4.4** - Report counting mechanism tracks multiple reports per item
