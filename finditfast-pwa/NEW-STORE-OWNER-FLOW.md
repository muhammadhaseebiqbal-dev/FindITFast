2. **Register with:** Name, email, phone, password
3. **Owner gets:** Dashboard access but no stores initially

### **Step 2: Store Request from Owner Dashboard**
**Owners request stores from their own dashboard**

1. **Owner Dashboard:** http://localhost:5175/owner/dashboard
2. **Click:** "Request New Store" button in Quick Actions
3. **Fill form:** Store name, address, optional notes
4. **Result:** Request submitted for admin approval

### **Step 3: Admin Approval** 
**ONLY app admin can approve and CREATES actual stores**

1. **Admin Login:** http://localhost:5175/admin/auth
   - Email: `admin@finditfast.com`
   - Password: `AdminPassword123!`
2. **Admin Dashboard:** Review pending requests **from ALL store owners**
3. **Admin Authority:** Only admin can approve/reject requests
4. **Click Approve:** **Admin action creates real store record!**
5. **Store Created:** Automatically linked to requesting owner

### **Step 4: Store Owner Management**
**Owner manages ONLY their approved stores**

1. **Owner Dashboard:** Shows "My Stores" section  
2. **Own Stores Only:** Owners see only their approved stores
