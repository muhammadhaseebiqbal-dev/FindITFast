# This is a placeholder for the mobile screenshot
# In a real implementation, this would be a PNG image file showing the app's interface
# The screenshot should be 375x812 pixels and show the main search/floorplan interface
# You can generate this by taking a screenshot of the app running on mobile or use a tool like Playwright
