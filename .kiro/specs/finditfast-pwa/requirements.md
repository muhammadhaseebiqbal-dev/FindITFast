# Requirements Document

## Introduction

FindItFast is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to help users quickly locate items within physical stores. The application serves two primary user types: everyday shoppers who need to find specific items in stores, and store owners who want to upload their store layouts and item locations. The core value proposition is reducing the time customers spend searching for items in unfamiliar stores while supporting local businesses through improved customer experience.

The application follows a mobile-first design approach and must be installable as a PWA, allowing users to add it to their home screen for native-like experience. The system uses Firebase as the backend for data storage, authentication, and file management.
